      <h2>Front-end Coders - Mauritius</h2>
      <p>
        Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
        expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
        body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
        choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any
        form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
        venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
        media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
        or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference
        organisers.
      </p>

      <h2>Linux User Group of Mauritius</h2>
      <p>
        The Linux User of Mauritius or as commonly called LUGM, is perhaps the
        oldest user group of the island. It re-groups Linux users from different
        corners of the island. Their main activities are organising Linux
        installation festivals and helping users with common *nix troubleshooting.
        LUGM members often speak at local events about open source software.
      </p>

      <h2>openSUSE Mauritius</h2>
      <p>
        A group of openSUSE users that manage the opensuse.mu blog. They mainly
        write about tweaks and fixes for the different versions of openSUSE. They
        also bring news from the openSUSE community. Feel free to wave at the green
        geekos during the conference, you may identify them with their chameleon
        t-shirts or with gecko plushes hanging around the conference venue.
      </p>

      <h2>Ubuntu Mauritius</h2>
      <p>
        The Ubuntu LoCo team is undergoing a revival after being dormant for some
        years. Ubuntu users and welcomed to <a href="https://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-mu/">
        join the group</a> on the Ubuntu loco team portal.
      </p>

      <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
        identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
        sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
        material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
        organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
        the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
        immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing
        branded t-shirts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
        security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
        those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
        conference. We value your attendance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop
        venues and conference-related social events
